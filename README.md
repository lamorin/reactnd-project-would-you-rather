# WOULD YOU RATHER

A simple yet a cool game as final project of Udacity's nano degree program

## Cloning the project

`git clone https://github.com/lamorin/reactnd-project-would-you-rather.git`

## Installing the project

`yarn install`

## Running the project

`yarn start`

If everything went right you should now see the project running on http://localhost:3000/ (assuming the port wasn't being used by another process)
